====================

Drone controller using raspberry pi.

This code is from vjaunet/QUADCOPTER (https://github.com/vjaunet/QUADCOPTER) - very nice code 
for raspberry quadcopter controller. It's in c/c++, and easy to understand. There is also the Android app remote
used to control the raspberry pi.

Wiring:
MPU6050 : -VDD -> 3.3V -GND -> GND -SDA -> SDA -SCL -> SCL -VIO -> 3.3V
